# Welcome!

This is `fasthawkes`, a C/Cython implementation for simple computation of a specific type of Hawkes processes assuming bounded delay densities.

Instructions for the use of the code are found in `Example_Run.ipynb`, a jupyter notebook.

Before use, do not forget to build with:

```
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
